# Creatures-of-Calden
Old school text-based RPG

I began creating this game when I started learning C#.  The goal behind it was to have a fun way to put my new knowledge into practical application and keep my skills sharp.  Learning concepts and understand the theory of their application is one thing, but using them to create something new instead of performing kata's leads to a better and more thorough understanding for me.

It's a fun little multiple choice text-based RPG with combat, stealth, and individual class features.  I'm still planning on adding to it, and now that I'm more experienced it's in need of refactoring.  But it has been a great way for me to familiarize myself with some of the concepts and processes I've learned.
